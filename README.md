# Tic-Tac-Toe

## My Approach 

* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

The first thing I did was read all of the material given to me about the requirements of the game. After I had a good understanding I drafted out some planning items such as a wireframe of the interface and a make-shift scrum board. I wanted to make the scrum board so I can keep track of the technical requirements and organize the stories so I can think about how I will test each feature. 

After I got all of the planning done I had to start actually working. First, I took some time to see how some people approach this problems. I found a lot of documentation on two-player games using JavaScript and a lot of tic-tac-toe examples. After taking in a lot of the JavaScript information, I felt overwhelmed on where to start. So I decided to switch gears and work on the website layout. Since I drafted up the wireframe of my interface I used that as a guide. 

## Wireframes and User Stories

**Wireframe Sketch via Google Draw**

I have pulled together a very basic design for the tic-tac-toe game. This acts as a guide for when I am building the HTML/CSS.

**My Scrum Board** 

I love JIRA but since I do not have access for this project I decided to throw together a basic board via google draw. This board has all of the main features/stories and I plan to use this as a guide for my work. You can find the board here: (https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1SqDQgx5XzseRqQuO9UT3oTBHObxgj2ryAV-AWjqI9UI/edit)
