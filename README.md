# Tic-Tac-Toe

## My Approach 

* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

## Wireframes and User Stories

**Wireframe Sketch via Google Draw**

I have pulled together a very basic design for the tic-tac-toe game. This acts as a guide for when I am building the HTML/CSS.

**My Scrum Board** 

I love JIRA but since I do not have access for this project I decided to throw together a basic board via google draw. This board has all of the main features/stories and I plan to use this as a guide for my work. You can find the board here: (https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1SqDQgx5XzseRqQuO9UT3oTBHObxgj2ryAV-AWjqI9UI/edit)
